// The Prototype Pattern lets you create new objects by cloning an existing object, instead of creating them from scratch.

// In JavaScript, this fits perfectly because JS is prototype-based, not class-based.

// Key idea:
// Create an object → use it as a prototype → make new objects that inherit from it.
