2. **Set clear goal** (what to achieve today)
3. **Prepare environment** (DB running, files ready)

### During Session
1. **Take breaks** (every 90 min)
2. **Run every query/code** (don't just read)
3. **Make mistakes** (best way to learn)
4. **Take notes** (summarize in your own words)

### After Session
1. **Summary** (3 key learnings)
2. **Practice** (try on your own projects)
3. **Plan next day** (5 min)

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls

1. **Skipping practice** - Theory without practice doesn't stick
2. **Not running code** - Must execute every example
3. **Rushing** - Better to master 80% than skim 100%
4. **No breaks** - Brain needs rest to consolidate
5. **Not testing performance** - Always measure before/after

## 🎉 Motivation

> "Databases are the foundation of every backend system. Master this week, and you'll stand out in 90% of interviews."

**Remember:**
- Each concept builds on previous ones
- Hands-on practice is crucial
- Ask "why?" not just "how?"
- Real projects > tutorials

**You've got this!** 💪
