# 📦 What Are **Dependency Vulnerabilities**?

**Dependency vulnerabilities** are **security weaknesses** found in the **third-party libraries or packages** that your application depends on — either directly or indirectly.

These libraries are installed via package managers like `npm`, `yarn`, `pip`, `composer`, etc., and form part of your application’s **software supply chain**.

---

## 🔍 Why Do They Matter?

Modern apps rely on **hundreds (or thousands)** of dependencies. Even if **your code is secure**, a vulnerability in just **one package** — or a **sub-dependency** of that package — can **expose your entire app** to attacks.

## 🧨 Examples of Dependency Vulnerabilities

| Type                                | Description                                                                        | Example                                            |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Prototype Pollution**             | Malicious inputs modify global `Object.prototype`, breaking logic or enabling RCE. | Found in `lodash`, `merge-deep`, etc.              |
| **ReDoS (Regex Denial of Service)** | Inefficient regular expressions cause CPU to spike and hang the server.            | Found in `marked`, `minimatch`                     |
| **Arbitrary Code Execution**        | Malicious package runs code during install or runtime.                             | Famous `event-stream` incident                     |
| **Directory Traversal**             | Access to files outside allowed folders.                                           | Found in `send` and other HTTP file servers        |
| **Command Injection**               | User input gets executed in a shell.                                               | Poorly sanitized inputs in packages like `shelljs` |
| **Insecure Cryptography**           | Uses weak or broken cryptographic algorithms.                                      | Using `MD5`, `Math.random()` for tokens            |

## 🧬 How Do They Enter Your Project?

1. **Direct Dependencies**
   You install them manually, e.g.,

   ```bash
   npm install express
   ```

2. **Transitive (Indirect) Dependencies**
   Installed **as a sub-dependency** of another package, often without your knowledge.

## ⚠️ Real-World Impact

* 🔓 **Data breaches** (user data leakage)
* 🕵️‍♂️ **Remote code execution** (attacker runs code on your server)
* 🐢 **Denial of service** (server hangs)
* 🧪 **Malicious installs** (compromise during `npm install`)

## 🛡 How to Detect and Fix Them

| Tool                    | What It Does                                                 |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `npm audit`             | Scans for known vulnerabilities in `package-lock.json`       |
| `npm audit fix`         | Attempts to auto-update vulnerable dependencies              |
| [Snyk](https://snyk.io) | Monitors and alerts for new vulnerabilities                  |
| GitHub Dependabot       | Creates PRs when a fix is available for a vulnerable package |
| `npm outdated`          | Lists outdated packages that might include patches           |

## ✅ Best Practices to Avoid Dependency Vulnerabilities

1. **Run `npm audit` regularly** in CI/CD pipelines
2. **Avoid blindly installing new packages** without checking credibility
3. **Keep dependencies up to date**
4. **Use minimal dependencies** — don’t install bloated packages
5. **Lock dependency versions** with `package-lock.json`
6. **Audit transitive dependencies** (tools like `npm ls` help)

## 🔐 Summary

> **Dependency vulnerabilities** are security risks in the third-party libraries your app depends on. They're dangerous because they often go unnoticed — and can be exploited to gain access to or disrupt your application.
