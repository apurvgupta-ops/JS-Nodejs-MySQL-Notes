1. Subarrays with Given Sum (Prefix Hashing)
   Question:
   Count number of subarrays whose sum is a given target.

Example:
Input: [1,1,1], target = 2
Output: 2

Explanation:
Subarrays [1,1] (at index 0 and 1) and [1,1] (at index 1 and 2).

8. Check if array contains nearby duplicate within K distance
   Question:
   Find if two same numbers exist within k distance in array.

Example:
Input: [1,2,3,1], k = 3
Output: true

Explanation:
1 appears at distance 3.

9. Group Anagrams Together
   Question:
   Group all anagrams into lists.

Example:
Input: ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
Output: [["eat","tea","ate"], ["tan","nat"], ["bat"]]

Explanation:
Words with same sorted letters belong together.

10. Count Distinct Elements in Every Window of Size K
    Question:
    Given an array, and a window size k, find number of distinct elements in every window.

Example:
Input: [1,2,1,3,4,2,3], k = 4
Output: [3,4,4,3]

Explanation:

Window [1,2,1,3] → 3 distinct (1,2,3)

Window [2,1,3,4] → 4 distinct (2,1,3,4)

etc.
